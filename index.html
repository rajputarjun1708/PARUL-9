Dear,<br>

My life is beautiful because of you my love my lady love. You entered into my life as a candlelight in the dark. You showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care. I know your shy nature doesnâ€™t let you open up to me; but your eyes speak up the love you have for me.
<br>
<br>
<p> And sorry for everythin jo bhi maine galat kiya ho yaa kabhi galti se bhi tera dil dhukaya ho, vese hurt tou bohot baar kiya hoga tu batati nhi hai mujhe, so sorry for those things.
